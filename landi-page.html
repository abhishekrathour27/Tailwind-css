            <p>Introduction to Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a deep
                catalog of CSS classes and tools to easily style websites or applications. It was created by Adam
                Wathan, Jonathan Reinink, David Hemphill, and Steve Schoger and is now developed by Tailwind Labs.

                Utility-First Concept: The main differentiating feature of Tailwind is its utility-first concept, which
                refers to the use of classes built around
                specific style elements, such as colors, fonts, or layouts, rather than components like buttons or
                tables.
                Utility Classes: Tailwind offers a wide variety of utility classes that can be used to style elements,
                such as bg-yellow-300 for a
                yellow background color or font-bold for bold text.
                Variants: Tailwind also provides variants, which allow developers to apply utility classes only in
                certain situations, such as when the screen size
                is at least a certain value or when an element is hovered over.
                Customization: Tailwind allows developers to customize their design system by creating their own
                reusable components using utility classes.
